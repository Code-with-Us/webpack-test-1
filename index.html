    <title>Webpack Test 5</title>

</head>

<body>

    <p>We've initialized our project and installed webpack and webpack-cli. </p>

    <p>We have an html.index file and a 'src' directory in which we've placed our index.js file. index.js contains very little, other than an import of a second JS file, also in the src directory, called hello.js. </p>

    <p>Now run 'npx webpack.' This command will create a new 'dist' folder containing a file called 'main.js' that in turn contains all of our processed and bundled JavaScript. 'main.js' is the default name that webpack gives our bundled JS.</p>

    <p>In order to see our script in action, we'll need to return to index.html and insert a script tag to import main.js from 'dist/main.js'. </p>

    <p>That's it! We can serve index.html or just open the file in a browser.</p>

    <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
